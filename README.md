# This is Java basic Project

## Java Simple Cashier App
This is a simple Store management project using Java language. This project is really good if you wanted to use it for a college project, if your university was using Java to teach you. You can clone this project if you are interested. FYI, this project is using MySQL for the databases, so you need to install MySQL to your PC first and every text that are displayed was using Indonesian, so you have to translate that to English if you're not from Indonesia, but it's a good start for your project.
